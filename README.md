# Coffee

## About

Coffee is a minimalist theme and color scheme with an earthy flair for Sublime Text / Textmate. It is largely based on the excellent theme [Flatland](https://github.com/thinkpixellab/flatland), which is in turn based on [Soda](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme). Two great places to start if you're developing your own themes.

Version 1.6.1 released October 18, 2018.

## Installation

The Coffee Theme is a sublime package and is designed to work with [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) and [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3). As well as [Textmate](http://macromates.com/).

### Sublime Package Control

Coffee can be easily installed using the excellent [Sublime Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/).

* Open `Package Control: Install Package` from the Sublime quick menu (Command-Shift-P).
* Select the "Theme - Coffee" option to install Coffee.

### Git Installation

Alternatively, if you are a git user, you can install the theme and keep up to date by cloning the repo directly into your `Packages` directory in the Sublime Text application settings area.

You can locate your Sublime Text `Packages` directory by using the menu item `Preferences -> Browse Packages...`.

While inside the `Packages` directory, clone the theme repository using the command below:

    git clone https://github.com/Toddses/coffee/ "Theme - Coffee"

### Manual Installation

* Download the files using the GitHub .zip download option
* Unzip the files and rename the folder to `Theme - Coffee`
* Find your `Packages` directory using the menu item  `Preferences -> Browse Packages...`
* Copy the folder into your Sublime Text `Packages` directory

## Activating the Theme

Activate the theme by modifying your user preferences to include the following:

    {
        "theme": "Coffee Dark Roast.sublime-theme",
        "color_scheme": "Packages/Theme - Coffee/Coffee Dark Roast.tmTheme"
    }

If you need help locating your user preferences file, you can find it selecting `Preferences > Settings - User`.

## File Icons

Added in v1.1 are File Icons. These come from the Seti UI theme. I figured why reinvent the wheel when there's a great set already! Thanks to [ctf0](https://github.com/ctf0/Seti_ST3) for the Sublime Text port, and to [jesseweed](https://github.com/jesseweed/seti-ui) for the original Atom theme. Thanks to both for making their themes open source.
