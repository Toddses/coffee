# Coffee

## About

Coffee is a minimalist theme and color scheme with an earthy flair for Sublime Text / Textmate. It is largely based on the excellent theme [Flatland](https://github.com/thinkpixellab/flatland), which is in turn based on [Soda](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme). Two great places to start if you're developing your own themes.

Version 1.0 released June 30, 2014.
